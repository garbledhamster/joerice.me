      Hi, I'm **Joe Rice**. I'm a Systems Engineer by profession, a pragmatic generalist by nature, and a lifelong learner at heart.

      If you stepped into my workspace, you'd quickly sense my reality: toddler scribbles, DIY monitor stands, books scattered thoughtfully, and a Zettelkasten filled with insights. It's messy but authentic—a reflection of my drive for practical wisdom, clarity, and continuous growth.

      - 🪙 *Meditations* by Marcus Aurelius
