   # My Project Management Process 
   ---

   I use a hybrid waterfall/agile framework I developed over the past few years managing projects. My goal for the system was to reduce the cognitive load it takes for our team to plan projects; having a structured, understandable methodology helped me personally reduce my project planning time by 40%.  

   Each phase—Initiation/Identification, Administration/Management, Discovery, Planning, Staging, Execution, Closure—has a general set of tasks that need to be defined for each project. The tasks generally involve:

   1. **Identification/Initiation**

      - A client or customer brings in a request  
      - The request is quoted and signed  
      - Someone is assigned the project  

   2. **Management/Administration**  

      - General project management occurs in this phase  
      - Documenting meeting durations and notes  
      - Keeping a conversation log with the customer  
      - Putting time toward documentation  

   3. **Discovery**  

      - Talking with stakeholders about the systems they have  
      - Documenting a big picture of the environment with notes and screenshots  
      - Gathering analytics on the systems involved in the project  

   4. **Planning**  

      - Review the documentation from the discovery phase; start planning  
      - Build a project outline and task lists to accompany it  
      - Midpoint review with key stakeholders discussing everything found and the plan  
      - Develop a backout plan to undo any major changes  

   5. **Staging**  

      - Start provisioning the systems based on the task lists  
      - Adjust task lists as you go, keeping them up to date  
      - Do testing in this phase for whatever needs to be tested  
      - Meet with the customer before the execution phase  

   6. **Execution**  

      - The main part of the project that involves stakeholders and communication  
      - Execute backout plan as needed  
      - Report to the stakeholders throughout the process  

   7. **Closure**  

      - Compile all relevant handoff documentation into a single handoff document  
      - Finalize timesheets and notes  
      - Work with key stakeholders and discuss the handoff documentation and their feedback  
      - Close the project and bill the customer  

   By following this project framework, I'm able to quickly plan projects and teach the process to a team or individual as needed. It helps keep projects clearly tracked and documented. The system is efficient and makes it easy to stay on top of project phases and notes. I'm always looking to improve my systems, and this is no exception.
