  Hey, I’m Joe Rice—husband, dad, lifelong learner, and hands-on IT generalist who brings order to chaos (and calm to crises).

  **I believe tech should make life easier, not harder.** I’ve worn a lot of hats: frontline support, network engineer, project manager, and creator. My favorite part of this journey? Solving problems nobody else wants to touch—and making sure nobody has to fix the same thing twice.

  **Concrete example?** One time a customer factory-reset their core Cisco switch with a paper clip—instantly knocking their whole business offline. Within two hours, I had them running again: I reconfigured the firewall, used static IPs to access the switch, and rebuilt everything from backups. That’s my style—calm in the chaos, solutions in hand.

  **How I work:**

  * I run projects using ConnectWise Manage and OneNote, capturing every key detail.
  * My version of rapid logging (inspired by bullet journaling) lets me distill complex issues into action items anyone can follow.
  * I diagram everything in Visio—from networks and security plans to mind maps and presentations.
  * At the end of every project, I jot down what I learned or built in a Zettelkasten-style card—so future Joe (or the next tech) never starts from zero.

  **My core values:**

  * **Open-minded thinker & lifelong learner:** Always curious, always improving.
  * **Driven problem solver:** Obstacles are puzzles to figure out, not roadblocks.
  * **Loyal & adaptable:** I stick with the problem until it’s solved and never shy away from change.
  * **Optimistic, but realistic:** I approach each challenge with hope and idealism, balanced by a skeptic’s eye for detail and risk.

  This site is where I share my systems, notes, and insights for friends, family, and anyone searching for honest, practical tech solutions—or just a better way to learn and work.
