  # Who Am I?  
  ---

  **Joe Rice — Infrastructure & Automation Engineer**

  I transform complex, reactive IT environments into reliable, well-documented systems. My approach combines thoughtful design, robust automation, and clear processes to reduce downtime and support growth.

  ## About Me

  I began my career in 2015 at a managed service provider, responding to urgent issues and learning to maintain composure under pressure. Over time, I advanced through roles in support, projects, and engineering—always focusing on creating lasting improvements. Outside of work, I’m a husband and father applying the same disciplined mindset at home and in my ongoing learning.

  ## What I Do

  - Provide advanced troubleshooting and root-cause analysis  
  - Design and implement resilient network architectures (Cisco, Aruba)  
  - Plan and execute cloud migrations (Azure AD, AWS)  
  - Develop automation scripts and tools (PowerShell, Python)  
  - Build and maintain comprehensive documentation frameworks (SOPs, KBs, Zettelkasten)  

  ## A Decade in the Field

  In 2015, I began as a residential technician, installing and troubleshooting networks and workstations in client homes. My early work taught me to diagnose issues efficiently and communicate solutions clearly.

  Within a year, I joined the support team, handling escalations for both MSP and non-MSP clients. I resolved complex problems, refined support procedures, and contributed to knowledge base articles.

  As a project technician and knowledge developer, I collaborated with engineers to document workflows, create runbooks, and streamline deployment processes—bridging the gap between support and engineering.

  By 2018, I was promoted to systems engineer, leading both on-premises infrastructure projects and cloud implementations. I managed Azure AD migrations for organizations of 50+ users and designed secure hybrid networks.

  Today, my focus is on security architecture and knowledge development. I leverage a decade of field experience and collaboration with senior engineers to deliver solutions that are both effective and sustainable.
