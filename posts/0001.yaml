  I worked for an MSP for almost a decade, seven of which was as an engineer.  In my time as an engineer, I’ve developed a generalist skill set. Some professional highlights include leading 30+ migrations) (cloud, wireless, security, networking, and email), **resolving 95%** of tier 2/3 tickets without vendor escalation, and managing projects using Agile and PMP methodologies using my own unique project managment framework. I focus on learning practical skills, which has helped me become a more well-rounded generalist.

  Technically (on paper), I’m a specialist in support, networking, and security. I hold a Support Specialist Associate’s Degree and am certified in Network+ and Security+. I take pride in my education and believe certifications are incredibly important—especially today, when standardization is more necessary than ever, given how fluid the tech job market has become. I enjoy working on small teams, mentoring, being mentored, and talking about ideas.

  Anyway that's a little bit about me.
