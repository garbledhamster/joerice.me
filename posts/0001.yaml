  # Who Am I?
  ---

  My name is Joe—husband, father, pragmatic idealist. I move through life as a knowledge worker and engineer, but the surface never tells the full story. I’m always building, always learning, toggling between stoic endurance and wild curiosity.

  At home, I’m the one my kids come to with big questions and scraped knees. I’m the quiet anchor for my partner and the one who cheers the loudest for small wins—whether it’s a new word spoken or just getting through a rough day.

  At work, I break down complex technical problems into human-sized pieces. I build what needs building, teach what needs teaching, and move on to the next fire without fuss or drama. My role shifts with the challenge—sometimes architect, sometimes coach, always a steady hand.

  In the space between, I’m learning—constantly. I take what works in one part of life and use it to improve another, always trying to be better at both.

  If you ask me what I do, the answer changes. If you ask me who I am, it’s simple:
  **A builder, a learner, and a human—always moving forward.**
