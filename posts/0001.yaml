  # Who Am I?

  ---

  **Joe Rice**

  This little self "memory" is to remind me of where I came from.

  Imagine you're looking at a series of double-hook coat racks stacked vertically, each with room for a coat and hat. They extend upward, with no visible ceiling, disappearing into a foggy, infinite void. A tall, unstable ladder leans against the wall, seemingly endless and ready to tip over at the slightest touch. Each hook holds a coat and a hat, but only up to a certain height, far beneath the infinite space above. The hats have holes marking where badges were previously pinned, while the coats still display their patches.

  Examining the first hat, you see "Residential" written across the front. It has only a few badge holes—evidence that badges moved upward as roles changed. The coat patches depict distinct experiences: one shows a smiling technician handing back a repaired computer to a grateful customer; another illustrates someone knocking on a door, while inside the window, a computer sparks urgently.

  To reach the next hat, you must step onto the ladder. The first rung feels shaky. You climb to the second coat, labeled "Tier 1 Support." Its patches show someone seated at a desk; another patch depicts the same individual onsite, installing computers in a cubicle surrounded by other cubicles.

  Continuing upward, you arrive at the third hook. This hat reads "Projects Team." The patches depict a person installing hardware in a data center, another working with networking equipment connected to a laptop, and yet another patch illustrating them presenting at a roundtable with peers or customers.

  Finally, you reach the current coat and hat labeled "Engineer." This hat still displays badges gained from previous roles. The coat’s patches show someone standing before a whiteboard covered with sticky notes, another patch depicts them diligently writing documentation, and a third patch is split in half, illustrating designing on one side and implementation on the other.

  Although "Engineer" appears to be the current hat, nothing prevents the wearer from moving freely among hats.

  ### Professional Badges You Might Find on My Metaphorical Hat:

  Looking around the room, you notice other rows filled with hats and various types of upper-body wear—T-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies, long-sleeve shirts—each row representing different experiences.
