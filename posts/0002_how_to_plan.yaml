  # How to Plan for a Project  
  ---

  I use a hybrid waterfall-agile framework to guide every engagement through seven clear phases. This approach ensures structure without sacrificing adaptability.

  1. **Initiation**  
     - Define objectives, scope, and success criteria  
     - Identify key stakeholders and decision-makers  
     - Produce a concise project charter for approval  

  2. **Administration**  
     - Establish meeting cadence and communication channels  
     - Assign roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths  
     - Document budgets, contracts, and high-level timelines  

  3. **Discovery**  
     - Inventory existing systems, users, and integrations  
     - Capture network diagrams, configurations, and screenshots  
     - Note constraints, risks, and compliance requirements  

  4. **Planning**  
     - Break work into discrete tasks with estimated effort  
     - Sequence tasks in a simple Gantt or kanban board  
     - Schedule a midpoint review to validate assumptions  

  5. **Staging**  
     - Provision and configure test environments  
     - Develop and rehearse rollback and validation procedures  
     - Finalize cut-over dates and user-acceptance scenarios  

  6. **Execution**  
     - Follow the approved task lists, updating progress daily  
     - Communicate status to stakeholders at agreed intervals  
     - Log issues, apply fixes, and update documentation in real time  

  7. **Closure**  
     - Hand off final documentation and credentials  
     - Conduct a brief lessons-learned session with the team  
     - Obtain formal sign-off and archive all project artifacts  

  By fleshing out each phase with concrete deliverables and simple checklists, every project remains transparent and manageable—whether it’s a routine network upgrade or a large-scale cloud migration.
