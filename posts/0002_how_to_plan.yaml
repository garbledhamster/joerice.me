  # How to Plan for a Project  
  
  A five-step blueprint I’ve used on 100+ IT rollouts and freelance builds.

  ## 1. Clarify the Result  
  Write a single sentence that answers *“What does “done” look like?”*
  
  ## 2. Map Constraints  
  | Area   | Typical questions |
  |--------|-------------------|
  | Scope  | Must-have vs nice-to-have features? |
  | Budget | Money, time, and attention limits? |
  | Risk   | What breaks if this fails? |

  ## 3. Break into Milestones  
  List no more than **6 milestones**—each < 2 weeks.
  
  ## 4. Assign Owners  
  Every task gets *one* name. Collaboration ≠ shared accountability.
  
  ## 5. Schedule Review Loops  
  Weekly 15-min stand-up → surface blockers early.
