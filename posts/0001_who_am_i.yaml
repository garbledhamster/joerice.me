  # Who Am I?  
  *A quick intro to Joe Rice and this living portfolio*
  
  ---
  
  Hi — I’m **Joe Rice**: husband, father, lifelong learner, and recovering sys-admin-turned-knowledge-architect.
  
  For ten years I kept servers happy, wrangled GPOs, and automated everything that wasn’t bolted down. A recent lay-off nudged me into full-time freelancing, turning those skills into real-world leverage for local vendors, creators, and—let’s be honest—my own family’s future.

  ## Core hats I wear
  
  | Role | What it means today |
  |------|--------------------|
  | **IT Engineer** | Zero-downtime AD repairs, M365 tenant builds, conditional-access lockdowns |
  | **Knowledge Manager** | Zettelkasten addict, SOP writer, automation tinkerer |
  | **Entrepreneur** | Building micro-products (cheat sheets, courses, Shopify mini-sites) |
  | **Dad & Partner** | Montessori-inspired play, stoic reflection at 5 a.m., baking sourdough with the toddler |

  ## Why this site exists
  1. **Transparency** — I learn in public; you see mistakes *and* momentum.  
  2. **Proof** — Every portfolio entry links to a real deliverable or lesson learned.  
  3. **Opportunity** — If something here helps, hire me or copy the idea—either way somebody wins.
