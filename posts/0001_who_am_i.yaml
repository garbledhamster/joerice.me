  # Who Am I?  
  *A quick intro to Joe Rice and this living portfolio*  
  
  ---  
  
  ## The Short Version  
  
  I’m **Joe Rice**—husband, dad, recovering sys-admin turned knowledge architect, and an unabashed generalist on a mission to turn hard-won expertise into simple tools that help everyday people thrive. If you only remember one thing, remember this: **I build systems—technical, intellectual, and human—that create breathing room for growth.** Everything you’ll find in this portfolio is in service of that single, stubborn conviction.

  ## Why I’m Writing This  
  
  The internet is loud, messy, and full of half-finished “About Me” pages that read like LinkedIn résumés glued to Instagram captions. I want something different—​a **living origin story** that explains not just *what* I do, but *why* it matters and *how* it might serve *you*. Think of this post as a continuously updated handshake:  
  1. **Context** – where I came from and what shaped my worldview.  
  2. **Craft** – the skills and frameworks I sharpened in the trenches.  
  3. **Contribution** – the concrete ways I aim to leave things better than I found them.  
  
  If any part resonates, reach out. This portfolio isn’t a museum; it’s a workshop with the garage door open.

  ## From Server Rooms to Story Rooms  
  
  For a decade I lived in freezing server closets and fluorescent-lit cubicles, keeping Active Directory sane, patching zero-day exploits at 3 a.m., and scripting away every repetitive task I could spot. I was the guy who memorized subnet masks the way hobby chefs memorize spice ratios—​equal parts obsession and survival.  
  
  Then, two things happened:  
  1. **Family Reality Check** – My wife and I welcomed a toddler (with a newborn on the way), and suddenly uptime at home felt more urgent than uptime at work.  
  2. **Philosophical Collision** – I rediscovered Stoicism, Zazen, and Montessori parenting, realizing that *resilience* and *clarity* are just as technical as any firewall rule.  
  
  A layoff became the unexpected catalyst. Instead of job-hunting for another windowless NOC, I pivoted toward **knowledge architecture**—packaging know-how so others can deploy it faster than I ever could alone.

  ## Core Hats I Wear  
  
  | Hat | What That Means Today |  
  | --- | --- |  
  | **IT Engineer** | Zero-downtime AD repairs, Microsoft 365 tenant builds, endpoint hardening, conditional-access lockdowns. |  
  | **Knowledge Manager** | Zettelkasten addict, SOP writer, automation tinkerer, relentless documenter. |  
  | **Entrepreneur** | Building micro-products: cheat sheets, courses, one-day websites, and automation bundles. |  
  | **Teacher-Builder** | Translating technical gnarl into visual guides, flow charts, and step-by-step roadmaps. |  
  
  Each hat feeds the others. Engineering keeps me honest, knowledge-ops keeps me organized, entrepreneurship keeps me hungry, and teaching keeps me humble.

  ## What I’m Putting Into the World  
  
  After a brutal self-audit (and three strong coffees), I distilled my focus to **four flagship offerings**—the things I believe create the highest leverage for the widest audience:  
  
  ### 1. Skill-Building Workbooks & Cheat Sheets  
  *Audience:* Lifelong learners, makers, and “I-never-finish-the-book” readers.  
  *Why it Matters:* Most self-help skips the *practice* layer. My workbooks walk you up a six-level **Learning Ladder**—Exposure, Organization, Retrieval, Application, Analysis, Creation—with measurable checkpoints so you always know when you’re ready to advance.  
  *What You’ll Get:* Flow charts, shape metaphors, arrow hierarchies, and a clear metric for mastery. Oh, and every resource links back to [Zettelkasten.Shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/zettelkastenshop) so you can dive deeper whenever you want.  
  
  ### 2. Launch-in-a-Day Flat-File Websites  
  *Audience:* Creators and freelancers who need a professional landing page yesterday.  
  *Why it Matters:* WordPress bloat and SaaS lock-in slow people down. I deliver **secure, performant, single-page sites**—no database, no update anxiety—using GitHub Pages or a similar flat-file host.  
  *What You’ll Get:* Domain setup, SSL, a responsive design, and copy prompts powered by ChatGPT to help you ship good words fast.  
  
  ### 3. Fractional IT Engineering & Security Hardening  
  *Audience:* Small businesses (<50 seats) who can’t afford a full-time sys-admin but still need enterprise-grade defenses.  
  *Why it Matters:* Cyber-threats don’t scale down just because your headcount does. I bring a decade of MSP battle scars and a library of automation scripts that reduce billable hours and protect your sleep.  
  *What You’ll Get:* A tight M365 tenant, robust backups, conditional access, and a plain-English handoff document so you’re never held hostage by your own tech.  
  
  ### 4. Knowledge-Ops Kits & Automation Bundles  
  *Audience:* Start-ups drowning in tribal knowledge and solo operators juggling too many tools.  
  *Why it Matters:* Information should flow like clean water, not spill like a busted fire hydrant. My kits combine Zettelkasten templates, API glue code, and scheduled backups so your ideas are searchable, secure, and shareable.  
  *What You’ll Get:* A plug-and-play vault for notes, SOPs, and project docs, plus scripts to keep everything synchronized across the apps you already love.

  ## Guiding Principles  
  
  1. **Automation With Empathy** – I never script away a human touch that *matters*. Technology should amplify relationships, not replace them.  
  2. **Security Should Feel Boring** – If your stack keeps you up at night, it’s not secure; true safety is quiet confidence.  
  3. **Learning Is a Ladder, Not a Lottery** – Mastery isn’t luck; it’s ordered steps with clear “ready-to-advance” signals.  
  4. **Build for the Neighborhood** – Whether that neighborhood is your family, your team, or your city, solutions should serve the people closest to you first.  
  5. **Leave Breadcrumbs** – Future-you (and anyone following your path) deserves documentation—​even if it’s a napkin sketch captured in your note vault.

  ## How This Portfolio Works  
  
  Think of this site as a **rolling release log** of my mind:  
  - **Posts** capture experiments, reflections, and how-tos.  
  - **Projects** showcase live deliverables (site templates, scripts, visual aids).  
  - **Cheat Sheets** distill complex topics into one-page references.  
  - **Contact** opens a Formspree pipeline straight to my inbox if you need something built or fixed.  
  
  Everything is version-controlled, openly documented, and tagged for easy search. I believe transparency breeds trust—and trust is the only sustainable marketing strategy left on the internet.

  ## The Road Ahead  
  
  **May–June 2025**:  
  - Publish the first **three** skill-building workbooks (Reading, Note-Taking, and Thinking Clearly).  
  - Soft-launch the **Launch-in-a-Day** website package on Upwork and local networking groups.  
  - Release a free “Mini Zettelkasten” template via Payhip to grow the mailing list.  
  
  **Summer 2025**:  
  - Wrap the remaining **seven** workbooks.  
  - Host a beta **cohort course** combining workbook content with live Q&A.  
  - Offer **Automation-as-a-Service** bundles: pre-built PowerShell tools with optional support tiers.  
  
  **Fall 2025 and Beyond**:  
  - Expand the **Stoic Figures Timeline Site** with community contributions.  
  - Launch a **family-centric podcast** on resilience, mindful tech, and small-scale entrepreneurship.  
  - Develop a **Small-Biz Cyber-Readiness Kit**, pairing security hardening with one-hour staff micro-trainings.  
  
  None of these milestones are set in stone; they’re way-points in a learning journey. If real-world feedback steers me elsewhere, perfect—iteration is the point.

  ## A Personal Invitation  
  
  If you’re:  
  - **A parent** craving systems that create space for presence,  
  - **A creator** itching to ship without drowning in tool setups,  
  - **A business owner** tired of gambling with security, or  
  - **A learner** hunting for practical, visual frameworks—  
  
  —then pull up a chair. Send a note, grab a cheat sheet, or poke around the code. I’m building in public not because it’s trendy, but because it forces me to stay honest, adaptive, and relentlessly useful.  
  
  Thank you for reading this far. The internet is overflowing with content, and your attention is the scarcest currency I know. I promise to spend it wisely—by shipping tools, insights, and practices that repay your trust with compound interest.  
  
  **Forward we go.**  
  
  — *Joe*
