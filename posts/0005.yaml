  # My Learning Process in 2025  
  ---

  THis is my current learning process, so far I've been mostly sticking with it whenever I'm feeling the urge to learn someting or take notes this is generally the process I've used to fill my small "library" with interesting books that I can grow from.

  ### 1. How to get good self-learning book reccomendations with ChatGPT

    **Prompt:** I'm interested in learning about {SUBJECT/TOPIC/PERSON} please give me 5 books you would deam as 'permenant' books on the subject. If you struggle to find any 'permanent' books, looks for books that are at least 10 years old and have a proven track record for providing the reader with the best outcomes. If yet you still can't find high quality written material for an interested reader, ensure the book at the very least has a table of contents.  The reader needs to be able to grasp the concept as a whole as quickly as possible. We are going for high 'Transformative Value' on the first intentional read of the books.

    I used "Visual Learning" for the "TOPIC" and my ChatGPT recommends these books:

    1. **The Back of the Napkin** – Dan Roam - $4.37 on ebay
    2. **Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain** – Betty Edwards - $8.77 on ebay
    3. **Visual Thinking** – Rudolf Arnheim - $4.80 on ebay

  ### 2. Getting books for cheap is easy with your public library or Ebay

    **1:** If we are at the library I'll see if they have it, otherwise I go to Ebay and buy a used copy.
    **2:** If I can't find a used copy or it's unreasonably expensive, I'll skip the book and then go to the next one in the list.

    I checked out the top three books first (this was early 2025):

    1. **The Back of the Napkin** – Dan Roam - $4.37 on ebay
    2. **Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain** – Betty Edwards - $8.77 on ebay
    3. **Visual Thinking** – Rudolf Arnheim - $4.80 on ebay

  ### 3. Reading a book for the first time is definitelly my favorite.

    This part is straight forward, you just need to do a quick skim of the front matter, back matter, jacket (if it has one
