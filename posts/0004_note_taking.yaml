  # What Effective Notes Look Like to Me  
  ---

  Effective notes are clear, actionable, and tied to a defined purpose. They capture the essence of an idea, task, or reference—and guide you toward the next step.

  ## Rapid Logging  
  - **Definition**: A quick way to capture tasks, events, or ideas using short bullets and simple symbols.  
  - **When to Use**:  
    - During meetings or brainstorming sessions  
    - The moment an idea strikes  
    - To track daily tasks and mark progress  
  - **Basic Symbols**:  
    - `+` Task (convert to a project or calendar entry)  
    - `-` Note or observation  
    - `o` Event or date  

  ## Project Outline Notes  
  - **Purpose**: Sketch the structure of any new initiative before diving into details.  
  - **When to Use**:  
    - At project kickoff  
    - When breaking a large goal into manageable steps  
  - **Core Sections**:  
    1. **Goals**: Desired outcome  
    2. **Milestones**: Key checkpoints  
    3. **Tasks**: Action items with assignees and deadlines  

  ## Note Anatomy: Body and Purpose  
  Every note should include:  
  1. **Title**: A brief, specific label (1–3 words)  
  2. **Purpose**: A single sentence explaining why this note exists  
  3. **Body**: The main content—details, links, decisions, or next actions  
  4. **Tags/Context**: Keywords or categories for retrieval  

  ### Example  
  ```

  Title: Server Migration Plan
  Purpose: Outline steps to migrate on-premises servers to Azure without disruption.
  Body:
  + Inventory existing servers, applications, and dependencies
  + Schedule maintenance window with stakeholders (o 2025-06-15)
  + Backup data and verify integrity
  + Perform test migration in staging environment
  + Execute production migration and validate services
  + Clean up legacy resources and update DNS records
