  # Taking Notes Effectively  
  
  From conference rooms to Kindle highlights—my system in a page.

  ## Principles
  - **Capture quickly** — speed beats structure at the moment of insight.  
  - **Process later** — inbox-zero your notes weekly into Zettelkasten.  
  - **Link deliberately** — relate new notes to at least two old ones.
