      <p>As you can guess, I'm a parent, and I like to read books. I'm particularly interested in books that raise my vibrations as a human being and elevate those around me. I'm a self-learner and a self-starter. I am an internalizer, as described by Lindsay C. Gibson in her book <em>Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents</em>: "Internalizers are highly perceptive and sensitive, with strong instincts to engage and connect with other people. They tend to feel apologetic for needing help, do most of the emotional work in relationships, and think about what other people want first."</p>
      <p>I’ll be the first to admit I’m not perfect, but I believe we are all perfectly imperfect in our own little ways.</p>

        <h1>Experience</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>I've played video games my whole life, especially growing up as the youngest of three with the closest sibling gap being five years. That meant I got tossed into the deep end of competitive stuff like 007 GoldenEye on the N64, or I'd be 100%-ing Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask by racing to the local library to print out guides.</p>
      <p>I got my first computer when I was 11, after my dad reconnected with a high school buddy who was finishing up at Gateway Technical College in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. That's when I dove into coding, built Counter-Strike maps, messed with keygens, and learned a ton about the Windows registry. Basically, I was a black hat wannabe at my core, just soaking in everything I could.</p>
      <p>Fast forward to my sophomore year of high school in Odenville, Alabama, where the school literally employed me as a "techy." I’d get full credits each semester just for doing IT work. That felt like hitting the jackpot—real-world experience while still a teenager.</p>
      <p>Then I ended up graduating high school in Wisconsin, and it was kind of surreal walking the same halls I’d started in as a freshman, only now feeling way older and seeing everyone I knew just a couple of years further along than they were before.</p>
      <p>After high school, I ended up going to Gateway Technical College myself and got a degree as a Support Specialist, which was a natural next step after all those years tinkering with computers. And now I'm also a certified network and security specialist—it keeps me on my toes, constantly learning and staying ahead of the game.</p>
      <p>I worked at the post office for about 2.5 years—originally, I was supposed to just be part-time, but the clerk running the office got sick with cancer, so I ended up managing that entire operation six days a week for two years. After that, I was “promoted” to the main office, which I loathed with a passion. Deep down, I knew that wasn’t my destiny. I was still going to school in the evenings, and that’s when a friend introduced me to this "MSP" world I’d never heard of. I decided to take a shot, and that’s where my journey into the capitalist tech realm kicked off.</p>
      <p>I moved up quickly—residential role, then tier 1, then onto the projects team in a position my coworkers affectionately called "projects bitch." I got to work under two engineers with a combined 50 years of experience, and for around four of those years, I was directly shadowing one of the owners like a total sponge. His patience in teaching me everything shaped how I think today, pushing me to be pretty decent forward-thinker and problem-solver.</p>
      <p>Now, I’m n lead engineer at that same MSP where. My day-to-day revolves around coding, design, planning, and execution of all kinds of systems. I’ve got a wide range of responsibilities because, honestly, what I do can’t be pinned down with a neat little label. It's become a place of steady growth for me, and that’s exactly how I like it.</p>

            <li>Being a <a href="https://dailystoic.com/life-is-school-school-is-for-life/">lifelong learner</a> has taught me that writing is essential to learning. Not only do I keep a bullet journal, but I also maintain an analog zettelkasten. It allows me to write down moments of "genius" that I can revisit later in life or throughout my journey. I tend to use it for everything related to Mind, Body, Spirit, Life.</li>
            <li>I've even built a dedicated website for it: <a href="https://zettelkasten.shop">Zettelkasten.Shop</a>. This helps me share the system with more people and provides a starting point for those interested in learning about it.</li>
            <li>My zettelkasten is literally my <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/">Second brain</a> system that I can pass down to my children or use to write books someday, just as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann">Niklas Luhmann</a>, the creator of the zettelkasten method, did.</li>
