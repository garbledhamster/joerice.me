				<p>
					As you might have guessed, I’m a parent, a self-learner, and a problem-solving enthusiast. I’m also what the author Lindsay C. Gibson might call an “internalizer,” which is a fancy way of
					saying I tend to do a lot of the emotional lifting in my relationships. Not gonna lie—it can be tiring, but it does help me see the best in people (most days).
				</p>
				<p>I’m far from perfect, but I like to think our imperfections are what make us interesting—and probably a little funnier, too.</p>

					<h1>Experience</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<p>
					My love for tech started early, thanks to being the youngest of three and usually the guinea pig when it came to gaming. I cut my teeth on <em>007 GoldenEye</em> for N64 (yes, I got whooped
					plenty). I’d also bike to the local library to print out game guides for <em>Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>Majora’s Mask</em>—my idea of high adventure back then.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I was 11, my dad’s friend from Gateway Technical College gave me my first computer, launching me straight into coding, Windows registry diving, and, well, random hacking experiments
					that made me feel like I was in a secret spy movie. By high school, I was basically “the IT kid,” earning full credits while fixing the school’s computers.
				</p>
				<p>
					I eventually finished high school back in Wisconsin—same place I started as a freshman, but it felt worlds apart. After that, I followed my dad’s buddy’s footsteps to Gateway Technical
					College, snagged a Support Specialist degree, and later layered on network and security certifications. Yep, I’m the proud geek who found actual joy in learning about subnets and firewalls.
				</p>
				<p>
					I briefly worked at the post office, which sounds cozy, but in reality, I ended up running the place six days a week for two years when a coworker fell ill. After a less-than-pleasant
					transfer to the main office, I knew it was time to move on. A friend nudged me toward an MSP (Managed Service Provider), a world I never knew existed, and I jumped in headfirst.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started at the bottom, moved to tier 1, joined the projects team, and then shadowed one of the owners for about four years. That’s when I really learned to problem-solve and think ahead.
					Now, I’m a lead engineer at the same MSP, wearing many hats: coding, designing systems, planning out migrations, and orchestrating just about anything else that needs to happen. It’s a wild
					ride, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

					<h1>Purpose</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<p>
					This site is my corner of the internet—a place to share my projects, experiences, and hopefully a few laughs. It’s not just a portfolio for potential employers; it’s also a public scrapbook
					of where I’ve been and where I’m headed. I value honesty, growth, and community, so you’ll find bits of all three sprinkled throughout. Whether you’re here to check out my tech work or to
					spy on my reading list, I hope you find something that resonates.

							<ul>
								<li>
									My first taste of Cloud Infrastructure was setting up a Sophos BGP with HA in AWS—<em>before</em> it was officially supported. The docs were basically coffee-stained notes from
									Sophos engineers, but hey, it worked.
								</li>
								<li>
									Next, I dove into Exchange Online migrations when Microsoft was still figuring out how to handle them gracefully. I had to build out processes that Microsoft eventually replaced with
									its Exchange Hybrid Setup Utility.
								</li>
								<li>These days, a typical project involves moving on-prem domains into M365 so folks can ditch the bulky servers and embrace the cloud.</li>

									<summary>Project management</summary>

											Over the past few years my project management skills have been becoming honed to a fine point. I've learned to juggle multiple projects at once, keep track of all the moving parts, and centralize communications with team members in critical situations such as customer down,

                <details>
								<summary>Virtual</summary>
								<ul>
									<li>I learned virtual infrastructure on the fly once I joined the MSP world.</li>
									<li>I started by troubleshooting virtual servers; next thing I knew, I was deploying them.</li>
									<li>Then I moved on to configuring virtual switches, then virtual firewalls.</li>
									<li>Eventually, I was setting up high availability across multiple sites in Green County (Monroe, WI).</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Security</summary>
							<ul>
								<li>
									I’ve been fascinated with security ever since I was tunneling through proxies in high school. It’s demanding, sure, but it’s also the glue that keeps the digital world from
									imploding.
								</li>
								<li>Nowadays, I help protect MSP clients by streamlining our security processes. It’s not all Hollywood hacking, but it’s still pretty fun.</li>
								<li>I prefer working from the outside in: cloud first, then the network edge, then domain security, and finally user awareness.</li>
								<li>When choosing hardware or software, I try to find solutions that make life easier—for both admins and end users—without making security an afterthought.</li>
							</ul>
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Wireless</summary>
							<ul>
								<li>I’ve done coverage maps for everything from small offices to giant warehouses, placing APs so nobody ends up stuck in a Wi-Fi dead zone.</li>
								<li>Implemented enterprise security with RADIUS (a lot of acronyms, I know) to lock down network access properly.</li>
								<li>Worked remotely with installers in multiple states, feeling a bit like a traffic controller with a giant coverage map.</li>
								<li>Set up angled APs in warehouses so scanners in loading docks don’t go rogue on me.</li>
								<li>Deployed a robust wireless network for a 100,000-square-foot warehouse (like playing Tetris but with signal coverage).</li>

							<summary>Home Security</summary>
							<ul>
								<li>
									At home, I always keep at least two separate Wi-Fi networks—one for my IOT devices so they can’t make friends with my main network, and one for everyday use. I sleep better knowing
									my smart toaster can’t snoop through my files.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Links</summary>
							<ul>
								<li>I think of “links” as virtual portals that help me share ideas. (Yes, kind of like how Neo jacks into the Matrix.) They connect me with the rest of the world and vice versa.</li>
								<li>I’ve gotten pretty good at spinning up quick websites that serve a unique purpose—like dropping breadcrumbs for anyone who stumbles upon them.</li>
								<li>
									It might sound a little over-the-top, but these links are how I leave digital footprints. They evolve as I do, and each one can be a stepping stone for the next curious traveler.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>My Zettelkasten</summary>
							<ul>
								<li>
									I’m a lifelong learner, which means I write <em>a lot</em>. My bullet journal and analog Zettelkasten keep me from forgetting all those “aha!” moments (or at least most of them).
								</li>
								<li>I built <a href="https://zettelkasten.shop">Zettelkasten.Shop</a> to share the system. It’s like a big file cabinet for my thoughts, minus the paper cuts.</li>
								<li>My Zettelkasten is basically my own second brain—just in case the first one needs a nap. I can pass it on to my kids someday, or even publish something if I’m feeling bold.</li>

					Your support helps me cover the bills for hosting, domains, and email services. In other words, it keeps these sites from crashing and burning at the worst possible time. You can chip in via
					my

				</p>
				<p>In practical terms, here’s what your contributions go toward:</p>
				<ul class="support-list">
					<li><strong>Domain Fees:</strong> So I can keep friendly URLs alive instead of relying on complicated IP addresses.</li>
					<li><strong>GitHub Pages Fees:</strong> Hosting that’s stable (most of the time).</li>
					<li><strong>Email Fees:</strong> Because reliable email is still more professional than carrier pigeons.</li>
					<li><strong>Email Security Fees:</strong> Helping me lock down email so nobody gets spammed with “you won a million bucks!” messages.</li>
					<li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> For DNS management and some extra muscle on the security front.</li>
					<li><strong>Time/Materials:</strong> Encourages me to keep building new stuff, instead of binge-watching TV shows all weekend (though that’s tempting).</li>
					<li><strong>Family Support:</strong> My wife and I appreciate every bit of stability we can get—especially with kiddos around.</li>
